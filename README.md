# Python-Sudoku-Solver
A Sudoku solver created in python with a GUI to display the results from an unfinished puzzle inputted from the user.
<br>
<h3>How to run</h3>

```python3 sudoku.py```

This project was created by using a backtracking algortihim for the main solving and then outputting the results. The results are outputted to a terminal but also loads up a GUI.
<br><br>
There is also a default board incase the user just wants to test which is promted to run if the user enters 1, alternatively the user can enter 2 to enter their own board.
<br><br>
The user enters their board via a GUI which the user indicates "blank" spaces with the number 0 and exits the GUI to proceed with execution of the rest of the program.
<br><br>
Another GUI will then open with the blank spaces ommited and replaced with the solved values, therefore a completed sudoku board.
